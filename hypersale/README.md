Hypersale eCommerce API

Overview
Hypersale is a full-fledged eCommerce API built with Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF), providing a platform where users can manage products, orders, reviews, wishlists, and discounts. The system supports user authentication and user-specific actions (like adding items to a wishlist, creating orders, and submitting reviews).

Features
Product Management: Users can view products, search by name, category, price, and stock.
Order Management: Users can create and view orders, including product details and quantities.
Wishlist Functionality: Users can add and remove items from their wishlists.
Reviews: Users can write and manage reviews for products.
Discounts: Allows admins to create discounts linked to specific products.
Authentication: All actions require users to be authenticated through Django's built-in user system.
CSRF and Security: The system uses CSRF tokens for protection and ensures secure POST requests.
